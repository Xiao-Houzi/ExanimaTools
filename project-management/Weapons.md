Exanima's weapons can be divided into two categories: procedural and non-procedural. Zetheros has stated that they eventually plan to have all of the weapons on the procedural system,[1] though it's likely some of the unconventional weapons (such as the Pickaxe or Juggling Club) will remain non-procedural weapons. All weapons found in the Arena Mode are procedurally generated.

Procedural Weapons
Procedural weapons utilize a pool of weapon components, qualities, and conditions. These attributes are not completely random and every loot table in game has weights for quality, condition, and component selection. This means that the weapons you find on Story Mode Level 1 will be poor quality and condition, and the weapons available on the later levels will be of higher quality and generally in better condition. While Quality is an unchangeable stat, Condition can be improved with the use of Spheres. These descriptors describe a numerical value assigned to the weapon. Weapons close to the line between two descriptors may appear as one or the other when you click open the description.

Weapon Statistics
Weight
How heavy the weapon is. Affects handling, encumbrance and has some effect on damage. Heavier weapons can resist the force of other heavy weapons when they block and are likely to knock targets over, even if they do not kill them, while light weapons are faster. Heavy weapons are also effective for grappling. Unaffected by quality and condition.

Impact
Impact force of the weapon. Applies blunt force damage to targets. Generally less lethal than other damage, but extreme or repeated impacts can still kill. All armour has at least some resistance to impact damage. Minimally affected by quality and condition.

Balance
Direct handling attribute of the weapon. Weapons with high balance are more responsive for their weight, allowing them to parry and inflict their maximum damage more reliably. Moderately affected by quality and condition.

Slash
Slashing damage of the weapon. Most heavier armour has high resistance to slash damage. Moderately affected by quality and condition.

Crush
Crushing damage of the weapon. Lethal blunt damage. Most heavier armour only has limited resistance to crush damage, and lighter armour frequently provides next to no protection whatsoever. Minimally affected by quality and condition.

Pierce
Piercing damage of the weapon. Moderate piercing damage dealt by short points or spikes on the weapon when swinging. Most heavier armour has some resistance to pierce damage. Moderately affected by quality and condition.

Thrust
Thrusting damage of the weapon. Heavy piercing damage typically done by longer weapons with a stabbing motion. Most heavier armour has some resistance to thrust damage. Moderately affected by quality and condition.

Some of these weapons do not have stats shown, but are still better choices than your bare fists. The items in this list with no page or weight info do not have stats shown but may still have hidden, weak stats. They are primarily used by zombies on the first few levels of Exanima's Story Mode.
