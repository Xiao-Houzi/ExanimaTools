# Add Team Member UI (Current)

**As a user, I want to add new team members via the UI, so that I can build and manage my Exanima team.**
- Add a button to the Team Manager tab to open a dialog/form for entering new team member details (Name, Role, Rank, Sex, Type, Equipment Profile).
- Validate required fields and allow saving the new member to the team list.
- Show a confirmation or error message on save.

## Subtask: Team Member Input Validation
- Ensure all required fields are filled before allowing save.
- Show inline validation errors for missing or invalid data.
