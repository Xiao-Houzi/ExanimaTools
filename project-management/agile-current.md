# Agile Story: Equipment Profile Management (Current)

## TASK DESCRIPTION
Implement, test, and document robust equipment profile management for ExanimaTools, focusing on model, persistence, and test coverage. Ensure equipment profiles (per-rank, per-slot, layered, with full stat details) are correctly persisted and loaded, matching Exanimaâ€™s requirements. All changes should be committed to a dedicated feature branch.

## COMPLETED
- Created and checked out feature/equipment-profile-management branch.
- Confirmed foundational model for EquipmentProfile and TeamMember (per-rank, per-slot, layered equipment) is present and robust.
- Extended TeamMemberRepository to use a normalized DB schema with new tables: EquipmentProfiles and EquippedItems, and updated AddAsync, GetByIdAsync, UpdateAsync, and DeleteAsync to handle full profile persistence.
- Updated EquippedItems table and logic to store/load all EquipmentPiece details (name, type, slot, layer, description, quality, condition, and stats as JSON).
- Updated and fixed TeamMemberRepositoryTests:
  - Ensured test DB is cleaned before each test.
  - Inserted required EquipmentPiece records for FK constraints.
  - Updated EquipmentProfiles_PersistsAndLoadsCorrectly to assert only on properties and stats that are persisted in EquippedItems (JSON).
- Ran dotnet test multiple times, iteratively fixing schema, FK, and stat round-trip issues.
- All model and persistence logic for equipment profiles is now covered by robust tests.

## PENDING
- None for model and persistence; next would be to implement and test the UI for profile management and stat display, if desired.
- (Optional) Refactor or add further tests for edge cases or performance.

## CHANGES
- Added/updated TeamMemberRepository.InitializeSchemaAsync to create all required tables.
- Extended EquippedItems table and logic to store/load all EquipmentPiece details, including stats as JSON.
- Updated AddAsync and GetByIdAsync to persist and reconstruct full EquipmentPiece objects for each equipped item.
- Updated TeamMemberRepositoryTests to:
  - Clean up the test DB before each test.
  - Insert required EquipmentPiece records for FK constraints.
  - Use parameterless constructors for TeamMember/EquipmentProfile to avoid logging dependency.
  - Assert only on properties and stats that are persisted in EquippedItems (JSON).
- Multiple dotnet test runs to verify and debug persistence and test logic.

## TOOL CALLS
- Used git branch/checkout to create and switch to feature branch.
- Used insert_edit_into_file for all code and test updates.
- Used dotnet test repeatedly to verify test and persistence logic.
- Used read_file and semantic_search to gather model and persistence context.
