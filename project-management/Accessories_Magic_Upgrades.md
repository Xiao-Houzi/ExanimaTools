# Exanima Equipment Types: Shields, Accessories, Magic, and Upgrades

## Shields
- **Shields** are a distinct equipment type in Exanima.
- They are used for blocking attacks and can be equipped in the off-hand.
- Shields have their own stats (e.g., coverage, durability) and are not considered weapons or armour.

## Accessories
- As of May 2025, there is no standard 'Accessory' equipment type in Exanima.
- The game does not feature rings, amulets, or trinkets as equippable items.
- Accessories are not referenced in official or community documentation.
- If 'Accessory' appears in code, it is likely a placeholder for future expansion or a generic category for modding.

## Magic and Enchantments
- Exanima does not have traditional magic items (e.g., wands, scrolls, enchanted gear) in the current public build.
- There are no enchantments or magical upgrades for weapons or armour as of the latest updates.
- The game focuses on realistic, physics-based combat and equipment.

## Upgrades and Modifications
- There are no upgrade or modification systems for weapons or armour in the base game.
- All equipment is found as-is, with no sockets, runes, or add-on items.
- Some equipment may have different qualities (e.g., common, rare) or conditions (e.g., pristine, damaged), but these are not upgrades.
