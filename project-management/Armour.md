- **Mail** (chainmail) is a distinct layer and appears as coifs, shirts, leggings, bracers, gauntlets, and shoes for various locations.
- Some armours (e.g., full plate) may cover multiple locations and replace several slots.
- See in-game tooltips and community guides for further details.

Exanima's armor system is layered, meaning different types of armor can be worn together for stacked protection. Here's a breakdown:
Armor Layering System
Armor is divided into multiple layers, each affecting protection and mobility:
- Clothing Layer: Basic garments like shirts, trousers, and boots. Minimal protection.
- Padding Layer: Gambesons and arming caps. Absorbs blunt force and improves comfort.
- Chainmail Layer: Worn over padding. Provides excellent defense against slashing attacks.
- Plate Layer: Heavy armor like cuirasses, greaves, and helmets. Best protection but reduces agility.
Armor Stats
Each armor piece has specific stats:
- Coverage: Determines how much of the body is protected.
- Impact Resistance: Reduces damage from blunt weapons.
- Slash, Crush, Pierce Protection: Different armor types mitigate different damage types.
- Encumbrance: Affects movement speed and stamina drain.
Some armor pieces conflict with others due to bulk—e.g., high-knee greaves may prevent wearing cuisses.

I can sort of help you
While there isn't an exact guide, layering goes like this; (These are all the combinations)

HEAD;
CAP > COIF > HELM

BODY;
CLOTHING > PADDING > CHAINMAIL > ARMOR

HANDS;
GAUNTLETS
GLOVES > VAMBRACES/BRACERS

LEGS;
SHOES/SABATONS > CLOTHING > CHAINMAIL > GREAVES > CUISSES
SHOES/SABATONS > CLOTHING > PLATE LEGGINGS
BOOTS > CLOTHING > CHAINMAIL > CUISSES

Please note that some pieces of armor will not work with others as usual due to constraints. For example, some greaves have high knee-guards that disallow cuisses.



Oh, If you want that here you are;

Clothing: Pretty self explanatory. Most cosmetics are in here. They offer minimum protection.
Hats
Pants - Cloth Pants, Leather Trousers, Silk Trousers
Shirts - Cloth Shirts, Suede Shirts, Silk Shirts
Footwear - Sandals, Shoes, Boots

Padding: The most basic form of layered armor. This goes underneath almost everything else and tends to replace clothing.
Caps - Leather Caps, Arming Caps
Gambesons - Padded Gambesons, Cloth Gambesons
Hands - Leather Gauntlets
Leggings - Padded Leggings, Cloth Leggings

Chainmail: Chainmail is the second form of armor, and it goes right over Padding. It tends to add a lot of encumbrance, however, and should be ditched after you attain some of the fuller armors.
Head - Coif
Body - Sleeveless Shirt, Short-Sleeved Shirt, Long-Sleeved Shirt
Hands - Chainmail Gauntlets
Legs - Chainmail Leggings

Non-Full Armors: This kind of armor is made out of separate pieces that you can choose to wear. While they don't provide coverage for anything other than their specific area, they weigh much less and are easier to find in higher qualities.
Head - Helms (There's a lot to pick from, and all are metal)
Body - Leather Cuirass, Splint Cuirass, Brigandine, Plate Cuirass
Shoulders - Leather Spaulders, Splint Spaulders, Plate Spaulders
Elbows - Splint Couters, Plate Couters
Wrists - Leather Bracers, Splint Bracers, Plate Bracers, Plate Vambraces
Cuisses - Splint Cuisses, Plate Cuisses
Greaves - Leather Greaves, Splint Greaves, Plate Greaves
Footwear - Plated Shoes

Full Armors: The most expensive and overall best armor to wear. They tend to cover large portions of the body alone and are quite heavy. However, they tend to offer the greatest rates of protection from all sources. When wearing this, it's recommended you drop Chainmail, as it will increase your encumbrance my a substantial amount.
Head - Plate Helm
Body - Plate Armor
Hands - Plate Gauntlets
Leggings - Plate Leggings (No feet), Plate Leggings (With feet)
Footwear - Plate Sabatons

Hopefully this answered your question fully.
