# Equipment Profile Management (Completed 2025-05-26)

**Goal:** Implement robust equipment profile management for ExanimaTools, ensuring equipment profiles (per-rank, per-slot, layered, with full stat details) are correctly persisted and loaded, matching Exanimaâ€™s requirements.

**Highlights:**
- Extended models and database schema to support layered, per-slot, per-rank equipment profiles.
- Ensured all equipment details and stats are persisted and round-tripped via tests.
- Refactored and expanded tests for reliability and coverage.
- All model and persistence logic for equipment profiles is now robust and ready for further UI or integration work.
